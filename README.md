This article reveals the fact that what makes a software helpful and unique is not only the technology behind, but the user group and demand addressed. As stated in the article, LinkedIn Live would compete with other live video streaming services with its target audience, who want to use live streaming for professional purpose. At first glance, the live streaming service may seem like a mature industry and it is difficult for a new company to survive, however, LinkedIn figured out another way live streaming service can be used based on the demand of its existing user.

I glad that LinkedIn is listening to its users and adding features that they want. I think that adding streaming will help keep LinkedIn up to date and I will be interested to see how it's used by companies once it's out of testing. I hope however, that LinkedIn decides to extend this and add a video call element. As a platform that is mostly used for applying to jobs, creating a way to host video interviews seems like a feature that would also be beneficial. Instead of using Skype or Google, LinkedIn could offer the service to video chat with interviewees and keep all that communication on the same platform.
